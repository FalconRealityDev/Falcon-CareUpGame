How to use MBS Utilities
========================
The purpose of this class is to simplify stuff that is normally simple to do but that needs to be done repetatively. 
To avoid duplicating the code and/or wasting your time doing menial repetitive tasks, this takes care of that for you
leaving you to focus on the logic of your code, rather than the monotony of repetition.

Example use:
	Normal: 
		Vector3 temp = transform.position;
		temp.x = 5f;
		transform.position = temp;
		
	Now:
		transform.position = transform.position.SetX(5f);

The functions the MBS Utilities class offers you are automatically available as soon as you installed MBS Core and
no further configuration is required on your end. Simply start using them right out of the box.
