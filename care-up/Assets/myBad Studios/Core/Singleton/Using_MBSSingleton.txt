How to use MBSSingleton
==========================

MBSSingleton is quite possibly the easiest way to turn and class that derives directly from
MonoBehaviour into a singleton and it will make sure to set Instance to null when the object
is destroyed

Here is how you use it:
	If you have this : public MyClass : MonoBehaviour
	Just change it to: public MyClass : MBSSingleton<MyClass>

That is it. You are done.
You can now access this class at any time by simply using: MyClass.Instance

NOTE: If you need to create an OnDestroy() function, be sure to override it like this:
	override public void OnDestroy()

That's it... enjoy your singleton.
