- Updated the wuss_login WordPress plugin to allow for this new function
- This function allows a person to sign in on your website using only an email and no password
	The intended use is to log a person in on your site AFTER you have verified their
	identity via Facebook or Twitter or some other means via a 3rd party asset
WARNING: POSSIBLE SECURITY LEAK FOR YOUR WEBSITE!
	If you do not intend to use Facebook or Twitter or sites like those to log into your
	website from within Unity then you might want to delete or comment out the loginTrustedLogin
	function. Alternatively, be sure to set a security string via the Dashboard and in the Unity
	prefab. Since all data is protected by an MD5 key and token you should be safe after setting this

	NOTE: These will not work inyour project unless you define them on your website.
