/// This script demonstrates that you need never modify the WUUGLoginGUI class as it is merely a cosmetic front end
/// The underlaying WULogin sends out events that you can plug into and that way link your code with
/// the login kit... Conversely, since the WULogin class does all the work it means that WUUGLoginGUI is entirely optional
/// and can be customised or replaced entirely, should you want or need to do so
/// 
/// Additionally, this demo scene will check to see if you have a game called "Demo game" created on your website
/// IF it doesn't find that game it will create it and update your local list of the games you have on your website
