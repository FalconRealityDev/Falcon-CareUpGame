  	<h2><strong>Thank you for purchasing the<br>Wordpress Login system</strong></h2>
	<p><div><strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
		<em>If you bought the WordPress Login for MBSCore package then you need to install the <a href="http://u3d.as/content/my-bad-studios/my-bad-studios-core/5ST" target="next_tab"></em><b>MBS Core</b><em></a> package also in order for this kit to work</em>.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
    <h1>1. QUICKSTART</h1>
    <p>In this quickstart section I will show you exactly how easy it is to get started using this kit..!	</p>
    <ol>
		<li>Install the myBad Studios Core product if you haven't done so already<br><strong><em>(Only applicable if you bought WordPress Login for MBSCore)</em></strong><br><br></li>
		<li>Install the Wordpress User Login kit into your project<br><br></li>
    	<li>Upload, install an activate the included wuss_login.zip file as a new plugin on your new or existing Wordpress website. You only need to do this once per website, not per game. If you haven't done so, yet, see the instructions at the end of this document<br><br></li>
		<li><ul><li>Find the Login prefab and enter your website's URL into the field named <em>online_url</em> (or <em>offline_url</em> if you want to work with a local website) without the trailing "/"</li><li>Make sure <em>use_online_url</em> is checked if you want to connect to your live website</li></ul><br>
	</li><li>Either open up the demo scene or create a Canvas game object in a new scene and drag the prefab onto the Canvas</li>
</ol>
	</p>
	<p>And that is that. You are now ready to hit play and see the kit in action!</p>

<p><blockquote class="codebg"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
As of V2.0, WULogin now includes the WUSS Portal.</p><p><strong>About the WUSS Portal:</strong><ul>
<li>It is a dashboard configuration section under which you can modify the settings of all WUSS kits that has any settings to configure</li>
<li>It is also the location of custom POST types that form a part of the WUSS series of kits and the unified location from where to create these posts</li>
<li>It also contains a series of WordPress shortcodes and widgets that offer a wide variety of uses on your website</li></ul>For full and detailed instructions on what the Wuss Portal is and what it can do, please visit the website at <a href="http://www.mybadstudios.com">http://www.mybadstudios.com</a></p><p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote class="codebg"><p><strong>EDIT:<br>ADDITIONAL STEPS:</strong><br>
Due to the inclusion of the WUSS Portal there are a number of additional steps required before you hit play in Unity<ol>
<li>Under the WUSS menu in the dashboard, click on All Games</li>
<li>Click "Create New" and complete all the fields you like but make sure to select a title for your game</li>
<li>Click "Publish"</li>
<li>Click on the WUSS menu in the dashboard and locate your game in the dropdown</li>
<li>Notice your game has a Game ID assigned to it. Copy that value into the login prefab in your Unity project where the prefab asks for a game id value</li>
<li>(Optional)Enter a secret value into the prefab's <em>security</em> field and make sure to add the same value in the Dashboard. This will prevent other people with this kit from accessing your database</li>
</ul></p><p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote class="codebg"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
	As of V5.0 you no longer need to enter the game ID manually. Simply click on the "Refresh games list" button on the prefab and it will display a list of all games you created on the website. 
	Once the drop down box shows you your games, simply select it from the dropdown list. Your game's ID is displayed underneath the button just for your information</p><p></blockquote></p>
	
<hr></p>
	<h2>A note on requirements</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>This kit requires that you have a working Wordpress website and that you have authority to upload and install plugins to that website. Website setup and maintenance falls outside the scope of customer support. This includes website redirects, confilcting plugins etc. If you encounter any problems with your website, please consult the Wordpress support website and forums<br><br></li>
		<li>If you bought WordPress Login for MBSCore, make sure to install that first just to avoid the shock of seeing a lot of errors until you do. ;)
		</li>
	</ol><hr>
	<h1>2. About the kit...</h1>
    <p>The Wordpress Login kit was designed for drag and drop functionality and as such it doesn't have much that you can customize. You can modify the aesthetics of the included prefab to make it fit the look and feel of your game (i.e. change the layout and positioning of the buttons and fields) but the Wordpress plugin(s) you installed requires some very precise info to be sent to it so there really isn't much you can (or need to) modify apart from the look and feel.</p>
	<p>Having said that, though, the kit was designed to be display agnostic and merely includes a GUI prefab to get you up and running in seconds. The graphics that you see when you activate the prefab is only a front end that call the actual functions within the WULogin class. Since the Wordpress Login kit works in the background and any front end you see is just a front end, it means that OnGUI, NGUI, Unity UI, any other UI kit you like, they are all supported!</p>
	<p>The code that does the actual work of logging you in, fetching your account details and resetting your passwords and all of that... they are each only 1 line of code. 
	All you need to do is collect the data each function needs (i.e. to login you need the username and password), add them all to a variable of type <em>cmlData</em> and then call the relevant function with that cmlData variable as a parameter and you are done. 
That simple. This is why it is so easy to make it work with any GUI system you prefer. Simply collect the info from your users and have your GUI system call the appropriate function once you have the info the function needs...</p>
	<p> Done!

<h1>3. Making it work with your game</h1>
<p>It might all be good and well that the kit is so easy to setup but how do you actually make it functional in your project? That has got to be the most important question you could possibly have right now. Well, in order to make this kit as simple as possible to use, I've designed it to use callbacks. As such, at the start of your project or whenever your project requires it, simply register a function to respond to the callback for your selected function and then, when the function has run it's course, it will call your function for you, allowing you to do anything you wish form there on...</p>
<p>For people new to callbacks I am sure that must sound like absolute Greek so allow me to demonstrate. You will find, included in the project, a file named CustomAccountClass.cs. This file demonstrates how easy it is to hook your own code into the WordPress Login kit. The key thing here is that you need never modify the Wordpress Login kit's code at all, simply create new scripts of your own and tell it what to do and when you want it to happen...then just sit back and wait for it to happen.</p>
<span><pre class="codebg"><code>

	void Start()
	{
		WULogin.onLoggedIn += OnLoggedIn;
		WULogin.onLoggedOut += OnLoggedOut;
	}

	void OnLoggedIn(CML data)
	{
		Debug.Log ("Yeah! Logged in! Now I can load my level!");
	}

	void OnLoggedOut(CML data)
	{
		Debug.Log("Oh, no! Like, game over, yo. Time to load the main menu scene");
	}</code></pre></span>
<ol>
	<li>First thing you need to do is define what callback(s) you want to listen to by adding a custom function to it</li>
	<li>Create your function and do whatever you want to do</li>
	</ol>
<p>That simple. No need to modify even one line of code in the WordPress Login kit and it is functional in your project.</p>
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr>
	<td colspan=2><h3>Following are the callbacks that you can hook into to perform custom actions...</h3></td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=2 class="highlighedrow">onRegistered</td></tr>

	<td class="fieldrequirements">success (bool)</td></tr>
