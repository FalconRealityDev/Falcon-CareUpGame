v1.1.1
- In-game items must by sold as virtual and non-downloadable. I removed the non-downloadable requirement for GAME types only
- Updated WUData to now allow you access to other people's data
- Updated WUData to include Pro mode
- Added additional documentation

v1.1
- Included the WordPress Serials asset and updated WordPress Money assets
	- This means you can now sell virtual currency and games via your WooCommerce enabled website. 
	- You can also verify ownership of your products via an online serial number and either 
		- force payment before the game can be played or 
		- let them do a few demo levels first before requiring payment.
		Either way, piracy is made impossible with this system because the game NEEDS a serial but
		the serial will only work for one person at a time...
		Ownership is determined on the server end
- Games bought from your website is automatically registered to the person who bought it so they never need to enter a serial.
- I updated the sample project to not require a serial to log in but instead to reward people who have a serial.
	- People with serials always start each match with full ammo and thus never have to buy any.
