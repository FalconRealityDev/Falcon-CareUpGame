Thank you for purchasing the WordPress for Unity complete collection

If you had bought the individual kits separately you will have found instructions for each as you installed the assets.
Since all the documentation is now included all at once I thought I'd point out how to get started and aavoid any confusion.

First thing to understand is that the WULogin kit is the heart of this system. 
Every single other kit in this asset is an add-on for the Login kit.
With that being the case I recommend you start with the documentation for the Login kit and install the login kit's plugin on your website first.

GETTING STARTED 101
To get started as quickly as possible, here is the bare minimum you have to do to get started.
For deeper integration see the documentation for the relevant plugins.

1. You must have a wordPress website up and running with access to upload plugins to it. 
If you don't have a WordPress website, create one first!

2. Read the login kit's documentation and follow the instructions on how to install and activate the login plugin on your Wordpress website.

3. In your dashboard click on the WUSS->AllGames menu option and create a new game. 
For now you just have to enter a name and then publish the post. You can enter the posters and game descriptions etc later.
Click on WUSS in the Dashboard and notice the GameID for the game you just created. Remember that value.

4. Find the 2 Login prefabs in Assets/myBadStudios/WUSS/Prefabs and in both set the GameId value to the value corresponding to your game

5. Now set the Online_URL field in both prefabs to your website's URL. For example: http://www.mysite.com 

6. Eiher open the Login demo scene (or create a new empty scene and drag WULoginCanvas into the scene) and hit play. 

That's it. That simple. 

To get started real quick, steps 3 and 4 are optional but since you will have to do it at some point anyway
I recommend you do it as soon as possible... but if your goal is to get started quickly then just:
	1. Install the wuss_login plugin to your website (if you haven't already)
	2. Give the login prefab your website URL
	3. Open the login demo scene and hit play.

That easy :)
Enjoy
