  	<h2><strong>Thank you for purchasing the<br>Wordpress Money System</strong></h2>
	<p><br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
    <h1>1. OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>The Wordpress Money system requires both the Wordpress Login kit from myBad Studios as well as the Tapjoy SDK (version 11.10 or later) from Tapjoy.com in order to work. Wordpress Money is a supplement to the Tapjoy SDK which means that before you can use this kit you will need to go to the Tapjoy website and learn how to integrate Tapjoy into your game. Only once you understand how to integrate Tapjoy into your game will you be able to make use of this package.</p>
<p>To keep it nice and simple, let me summarise what you will need to do:<br>
<ol><li>Create an account at Tapjoy.com</li>
<li>Create a game in the Tapjoy dashboard</li>
<li>Create 2 non hosted currencies for your game. One for iOS and one for Android</li>
<li>Create a bunch of placements in your Tapjoy dashboard then create content to put in the placements</li>
<li>Create a WUSS game in your WordPress dashboard and get it's ID</li>
<li>Add the keys for the currencies you created in Tapjoy to your game under the<br>WUSS->Money tab in WordPress</li>
<li>In Unity, create the TapjoyUnity object in a bootstrap scene using the<br>Windows->Tapjoy menu</li>
<li>Add the Wordpress Money component(s) to it then add the iOS and Android keys from Tapjoy to the Wordpress money component and the Tapjoy control panel</li>
<li>Learn how to use the Tapjoy SDK by visiting Tapjoy.com and then use it exactly as they instruct you to. Use it as if Wordpress Money was not even installed</li>
<li>The only exceptions are the functions and response delegates in the WUMoney namespace that replace the functions and delegates for spending, awarding and fetching Tapjoy points:<br>Instead of subscribing to the Tapjoy events, subscribe to the WUMoney events with the same name</li>
<li>The replaced events and functions have matching names but the identities differ:<br>Tapjoy delegates have different function identities per event while WUMoney events all have the same function identity. The WUMoney functions differ slightly also (see below)</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>And that is that. You use the Tapjoy SDK exactly as they instruct you to on their website. The only difference is that you call the WUMoney namespace to deal with the currency callbacks triggered by the GetCurrencyBalance, SpendCurrency and AwardCurrency functions inside the WUMoney namespace</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<blockquote>Instead of using: Tapjoy.SpendCurrency(50);<br>
You now use: WUMoney.SpendCurrency(50);<br>
And instead of Tapjoy.OnAwardCurrencyResponse += myHandler;<br>You now use WUMoney.OnAwardCurrencyResponse += myHandler;</blockquote><hr></p>
	<h1>2. Usage differences: Tapjoy & WUMoney</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>The SpendCurrency and AwardCurrency functions inside of WUMoney have 2 additional, optional parameters.<br>
			<ol><li><strong>string currency</strong>: If set to anything other than 'points' it will create a new virtual currency for your game, not affected at all by Tapjoy</li><li><strong>string meta</strong>: Tapjoy only ever reports whether or not a transaction was successful. WUMoney offers you the ability to send an extra bit of info with your transaction and have that info be returned to you with the transaction result. An example use of this might be to add a product id to a transaction...</li></ol>
		</li>

		<li>
Placements need to be declared, content needs to be fetched, tested if they are ready to be shown before they can be shown, be displayed then then new content should get fetched again before the next time it is needed. That is the simple process that Tapjoy uses. You are more than welcome to use placements exactly as they say, but if you want you can simply drop a <strong>WUTJPlacement</strong> component onto your TapjoyUnity object in your bootstrap scene and select the placement name from the drop down list. Once you have done that, all that remains now is for you to call WUTJPlacement.ShowPlacement(placement) where placement is an enum value specifying which placement to use. You can do it their way or you can use drag and drop and simply write that one line of code whenever you want to show a placement. <br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure you have a placement with the same name created in Tapjoy. Your placement names should use spaces instead of underscores, though.
		</li>
