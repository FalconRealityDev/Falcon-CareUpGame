## SKUs

- SKU stands for `Stock Keeping Unit` and it's a unique code used to identify and track products.
- The game checks if the user has access to the product and if so the user is allowed to access the content.
- The `Scenes.xml` in the path `Resources/Xml` has `isInProducts` which consists of all the `SKU`.
