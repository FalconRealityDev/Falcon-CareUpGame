# Localization

- The localization works by having a `dictionary (key - value pair)` the key is the same for both the english and dutch versions and the value is different when the language is switched.
- The dictionaries are stored in the path `Resources>Dictionaries`. There are separate files for dutch and english

## Editor Tools

- The Localization Tools are created to facilitate the addition or to edit the values for the dutch or english version.
- These `Editor Tools` can be accessed by going to the `Tools > Careup Localization`

### Editor Tool - Dictionary Helper

- The `Dictionary Helper` displays all the dictionaries that has been created.

## Switching the Language

- The language can be switched by clicking on the different flags button in the beginning
- The language switching is taken care by the script `Assets/UILangSwitch.cs`
